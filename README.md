## Formatting 

Use "GitHub" flavored markdown, a slightly different version of the "vanilla" markdown. The file extension is usually `.md`.
You can include equations in the usual LaTeX-like way, $Ax=b$, or like this
$$Ax=b.$$
You can view the source of this markdown document by clicking the edit/raw button on its source; it's also at [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/numerical-analysis-f23/project-help/main/readme.md).

You can also include images like this (notice that the image file is in the repository)!

You can also include `.gif`s!

Pseudocode is included via triple backticks, like this

and inline code can `go like this`.
